                    I was tasked with designing a political poster which would be pasted up directly on buildings and 
                    construction fences in New York City as part of a guerrilla campaign. As such I kept in mind that 
                    it will compete for attention with advertising, wild postings, graffiti, and other political material.
                    The campaign advocates for accessible medical resources and the poster needed to reflect this message 
                    clearly and effectively. I approached this by using the combined symbolism of pills linked
                    directly with medicine and diamonds with connotations of wealth and luxury. <br><br>
                    
                    The design was limited to that which could be reproduced on a three-color screen print. 
                    Practically, this meant I had three colors to work with for this design. <br><br>

                    The final display size on the street would be 26 x 38 inches, 
                    the ratio at which you see it now is 11x17 at 300 DPI which makes it ready to print.<br><br>

            <p class="wordsgen" > To the left is the first iteration of this poster after which I improved the following
            (as seen in the final product above) <br><br> 
            Diamond imagery was not directly linked to that of pills by many viewers in this version.
            To fix this I pivoted and utilized blister packs in place of a medicine bottle which helped make the symbolism
            behind the graphic more clear. <br><br>
            The overall composition felt unbalanced, in this case centering both text and graphics worked best over a diagonal
            composition. <br><br>
            The color palette felt a bit disconnected thus I completely eliminated the yellow and utilized dark blue 
            for the text in place of pure black. <br><br>
            Lastly, as a political poster it is important to have a clear call to action and a means for the viewer 
            to get involved, which is why I added the web address for, Medecins Sans Frontieres, an organization 
            advocating for accessible medical resources. <br><br>
