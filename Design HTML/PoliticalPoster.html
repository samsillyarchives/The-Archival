Imagine your work is part of a guerrilla campaign and will be pasted up directly on buildings and construction fences in New York City. Your work will compete for attention with advertising, wild postings, graffiti, and other political material. How will you distinguish your poster in this noise? <br><br>

                    Your design should be for a three-color screenprint. Practically, this means you have three colors to work with for your design. <br><br>

                    The final display size on the street would be 26 x 38 inches, but for the purposes of this project, you can scale down to 11x17. Set your files to 300 DPI so you will be prepared to print.<br><br>

            <p class="wordsgen" > To the left is the first iteration of this poster after which I improved the following (as seen in the final product above) <br><br> 
            Diamond imagery was not directly linked to that of pills by many viewers. To fix this I pivoted and utilized blister packs in place of a medicine bottle which helped make the sybolism behind the graphic more clear. <br><br>
            The overall composition felt unbalanced, in this case centering both text and graphics worked best over a diagonal composition. <br><br>
            The color palette felt a bit uncohesive thus I completely eliminated the yellow and utilized dark blue for the text in place of pure black. <br><br>
            Lastly, as a political poster it is important to have a clear call to action and a means for the viewer to get involved which is why I added the web address for the organization advocating for accessible medical resources. <br><br>
