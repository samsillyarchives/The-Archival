                Create a scale mock-up of your vehicle wrap for a Dodge Sprinter. Our client, Zibby, has worked as a consultant for a health and drug policy organization that would like to rethink the visual language of addiction and harm reduction. As part of a design proposal, she would like to include ideas for outreach vehicles that can meet with and provide services to drug users and their families in their own neighborhoods. 
                The name of the outreach truck for this proposal is Mobile Community Resources, and its tagline is Collaboration and Compassion.

                <span>First Draft</span><br><br> upon creating the first iteration of the truck wrap and receiving feedback from Zibby, our client, I made the following adjustments to the design to create the final draft pictured above. <br><br>
        I opted for a calmer color palette in order to cause less unnecessary public attention and to appear more welcoming to individuals seeking these resources. The composition was overall kept the same, however, text indicating specific resources, contact information, and the address to the physical office was included in order to to allow individuals the opportunity to continue seeking these services and also to accommodate to NYC regulations regarding vehicle wraps. <br><br>
