                <span>Project Brief:</span><br><br>
                Create an album cover for a song of your choice. The cover should reflect the mood and theme of the song, using appropriate imagery, typography, and color schemes. Consider how the design will look both in digital formats and as a physical print.
                The final design should be suitable for both streaming platforms and physical copies, i.e. vinyl or CD covers.<br><br>

                <span>Approach:</span> <br><br>

                For this project, I chose the song "Flores Amarillas" from the movie Floricienta. The song tells a story about love using yellow flowers as a metaphor for its beauty and fragility, I chose to emphasize that imagery. Since the original cover to this song is the movie soundtrack art I wanted my design to represent the story of the song rather than the movie it belongs to.

                To the left is an alternate version of the album cover I created. This one, however, within a 15 minute timeframe<br><br>
                I was asked to create a quick version of the album cover using the same imagery and color palette but with a different composition. <br><br>
                I chose to focus more on a cover which would suit a physical CD cover. I omitted text and instead focused on the imagery of the yellow flowers, though less object focused this time around by creating a more pattern like design. <br><br>
                I wanted the cover to remain clearly about yellow flowers but to follow a more playful almost handmade style, so I created a grid with varying shades of yellow and then hand drew the flowers within each square.
