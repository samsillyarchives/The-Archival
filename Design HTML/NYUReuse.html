                As part of an EG1001 course we were tasked with analyzing a problem and creating a solution to it along with a prototype.
                The problem we identified was the amount of overconsumption that moving in/out of university dorms creates. <br><br>
                To solve this problem we created NYUReuse, a second hand selling app specifically for NYU students to buy and sell items during moving in/out seasons. The app would provide a safe and secure way to buy/sell items as it reduces the market to solely NYU students and alumni which makes it geographically convenient and secure (as part of this service would include designated selling locations within campus).<br><br>
                The pretotype to the left is a wireframe of the app showcasing the user flow of the most basic app usages. <br><br>

                    To the right is a PDF containing a more in depth explanation of the project along with the planned user reaserch and testing that would be done to further develop the app.<br><br>
                    A small batch of user testing was done with 3 participants as part of the EG1001 course. The feedback was very positive and users expressed interest in using the app if it were to be developed. <br><br>
                    The main feedback we received was the need for a more robust search and filter system as well as a chat system to communicate with buyers/sellers. <br><br>
